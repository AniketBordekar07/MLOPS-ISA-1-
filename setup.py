    description='The project aims to predict IMDb ratings of movies using machine learning techniques. It involves data collection, data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The dataset includes various features such as budget, overseas revenue, runtime, release year, etc. The main objective is to build a regression model that accurately predicts IMDb ratings based on these features. The model will be trained on historical movie data and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics. Additionally, the project may involve feature engineering, model optimization, and deployment for practical use in the movie industry.',
